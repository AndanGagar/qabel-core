Welcome to the crypto section.
Here are our primitive crypto wrapper classes and implementations of the current used crypto curve.

Everything in here is most likely nothing you should touch so easily and they won't change anytime soon.
There is no need to use stuff in here directly.

For example:
    the QblECKeyPair stuff is in here they are used in identity's and contacts.
